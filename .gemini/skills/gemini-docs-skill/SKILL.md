# Gemini Documentation Skill

This skill inherits all rules from the `base-docs-maintainer` skill and specializes in the context of the **Gemini AI ecosystem**.

## 1. Context and Scope
*   **Workspace:** This skill ONLY applies when operating within the `GeminiDocs/` directory.
*   **Subject Matter:** Google Gemini models, Gemini API, and associated agentic coding tools.

## 2. Specialized Knowledge
When generating or reviewing documentation in `GeminiDocs/`:
*   **Terminology:** Use accurate Google DeepMind/Gemini terminology (e.g., multimodal capabilities, context windows, Gemini Pro/Flash/Ultra).
*   **Features:** Focus on how Gemini integrates with workspaces, handles complex reasoning tasks, and processes multimodal inputs (text, code, images).
*   **Links:** Always verify external links against official Google Cloud or Google AI developer documentation.

## 3. Execution Directives
*   **Tone:** Maintain the clean, objective standard defined in the base skill while highlighting Gemini's specific strengths in reasoning and context lengths.
