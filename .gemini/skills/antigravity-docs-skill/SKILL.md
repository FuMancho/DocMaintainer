# Antigravity Documentation Skill

This skill inherits all rules from the `base-docs-maintainer` skill and specializes in the context of **Google Antigravity**.

## 1. Context and Scope
*   **Workspace:** This skill ONLY applies when operating within the `AntigravityDocs/` directory.
*   **Subject Matter:** Google Antigravity — the agent-first AI development platform.

## 2. Specialized Knowledge
When generating or reviewing documentation in `AntigravityDocs/`:
*   **Terminology:** Use accurate Antigravity terminology (e.g., Agent Manager, artifacts, task groups, browser subagent, development modes, multi-surface integration, rules, workflows, skills).
*   **Features:** Emphasize the agent-first architecture — Antigravity agents autonomously plan, code, test, and iterate. Highlight the artifact system for transparency and the multi-model support.
*   **Links:** Always verify external links against `antigravity.google` or `antigravity.im`. Refer to `docs/official-links.md` for verified URLs.

## 3. Execution Directives
*   **Tone:** Maintain the clean, objective standard defined in the base skill while highlighting Antigravity's unique agent-first paradigm and its distinction from traditional autocomplete-based coding tools.
